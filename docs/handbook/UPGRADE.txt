UPGRADE
=======

From 0.4 to 0.5
---------------

A number of changes went into JSONBOT.

First i needed to change the stripname() function to make used filename
compatible with appengine. This means that most json data lives under a
different filename. To fix this i made a !chan-upgrade command which tries
to find the old filename and merge the data of that into the new file.

Second: I needed to make the bot debian compatible so we needed to be able
to start the bot from a different datadir (currently the local gozerdata
dir). This was a big rewrite as access to the datadir var in
jsb/datadir needed to be moved from import time to runtime as it can be
set in the using program now .. use the -d option to set a different datadir
as opposed to the default which is ~/.jsb now

Third: forwarding was a bit too open so i added a allowwatch attribute that
determines to what channel a forwarded event can be send. This way the
sending side can control to whom the events may go. Use !chan-allowwatch to
add remote channel to the allowlist.

to recap:

    1) move your data dir into ~/.jsb or use -d gozerdata 
    2) run !chan-upgrade to update you channel data
    3) use !chan-allowwatch on the sending side to allow channels on the receiving side if you use forwarding

From 0.5 to 0.6
---------------

The bot got refactored beyond sanity, so seperate upgrade scripts and
programs are provided to upgrade to 0.6

* on shell
    
use the ./bin/jsb-upgrade program, this will copy your data from ~/.jsonbot to ~/.jsb

* on GAE

copy over the files from ~/jsonregs to ~/jsbregs (cp -Ra)

Best is to upload the new bot into its own version (edit ~/jsbregs/<appid>/app.yaml)

Run the !admin-upgrade command, you may need to run this multiple
times until the bot says it's done upgrading, check if everything is still
working and switch to the new version.


you might need to run !chan-upgrade to update your channel.

From 0.6 to 0.7
---------------

in 0.7 a number of things changed, most of them relating to how programmers
use the bot code. 

First: bot/event classes were move into there own new namespace namely
jsb.drivers. So now you need to access for examples jsb.drivers.irc.bot etc.

Second: jsb.lib.version is now jsb.version

Third: the bot was rewritten to use the config variables directly. Instead
of doing bot.name = bot.cfg.name you should now use the bot.cfg.name. This 
is so changes to the config can be reloaded on runtime (i'm working on the config 
reload code).

4th: the ~/.jsb/myplugs dir got seperate into multiplie subdirs namely:
myplugs.socket (shell), myplugs.common (both), myplugs.gae (GAE). You need to move 
your plugins into one of those.

Thats it ! No changes needed to the filesystem so no !upgrade command to
run. It might be possible that a bot's config file (see ~/.jsb/config/fleet)
is not set, if so add it to the config file and restart.
