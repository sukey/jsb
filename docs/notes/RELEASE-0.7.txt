About
-----

JSONBOT is a remote event-driven framework for building bots that talk JSON
to each other over XMPP.

This distribution provides bots built on this framework for console, IRC,
XMPP and Convore for the shell and WWW and XMPP for the Google Application engine.

JSONBOT is all of the following:

    * a shell console bot
    * a shell IRC bot
    * a shell XMPP bot
    * a shell Convore bot
    * a Web bot running on Google Application Engine 
    * a XMPP bot running on Google Application Engine
    * a Google Wave bot running op Google Application Engine
    * the XMPP bots are used to communicate between bots   
    * plugin infrastructure to write your own functionality
    * event driven framework by the use of callbacks

Install
-------

You dont need to run the bot on GAE when you just want to use the shell bots of JSONBOT.
JSONBOT can best be run from the bot dir, the bot is self contained and has all the dependancies that are needed:

    * "hg clone http://jsonbot.googlecode.com/hg mybot" or download and untar the tarball.
    * cd into the bot dir and run "./bin/jsb" .. if the bot is working correctly you will get the console version of JSONBOT
    * same can be done for "./bin/jsb-xmpp", "./bin/jsb-convore" etc. .. check the bin dir for programs you can start
    * try the --help option to a program to see what command line options are available. 
    * you DONT need root for this

Ofcourse you can always run "python setup.py install" or "easy_install -U jsb" when you do want to install the bot globaly.
Debian packages are on their way, but might still take time as the ftpmeisters need to approve ;]

Thats it ! hope like this version of JSONBOT and dont forget to have fun with it ;]
